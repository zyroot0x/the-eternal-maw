# ⚫ The Eternal Maw

> "The universe began with nothing, and to nothing it must return."

**The Eternal Maw** is an incremental and experimental game developed using the **Godot Engine 4.x**. You take control of a sentient cosmic vacuum with a single goal: consume all existing matter. 

From subatomic particles to galactic clusters, nothing escapes your gravity.
