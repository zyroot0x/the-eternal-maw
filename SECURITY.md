# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to fixing security vulnerabilities in the following versions of our project:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.2x  | :white_check_mark: |

> **Note:** We recommend always using the latest version of the `main` branch to ensure you have the most recent security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** Reporting vulnerabilities publicly could expose users to risk.
2. Please report the vulnerability through **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (under the "Security" tab of this repository).
3. Alternatively, you can send an email to: **emanuel.diegorl@gmail.com**.

### What to include in your report
To help us fix the issue faster, please include:
* A description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue (a proof-of-concept script or screenshots are very helpful).
* The potential impact of the vulnerability.

### Our Response Process
* **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
* **Triage:** We will investigate and confirm the vulnerability.
* **Fix:** We will work on a patch and keep you updated on the progress.
* **Disclosure:** Once the fix is released, we will give you proper credit (if desired) and publish a security advisory.

Thank you for helping keep this project safe!
